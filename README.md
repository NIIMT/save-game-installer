# save-game-installer
Vortex extension that detects BGS games and auto installs save files to \Saves
SGI — Save Game Installer (Vortex)

Version: 2.10 • Scope: Multi-game support, minimal change to framework

What this does

Automatically finds save files inside installed mods and moves (or copies) them into the correct Documents\My Games<Game>\Saves folder for the current game. It runs at startup, after installing a mod, and after deployment. Co-saves (SKSE/NVSE/etc.) are handled with the primary save.

Data-first scan (recursively scans Data/ if present; otherwise treats the mod root as Data).

Root-level saves are picked up.

Recurses into immediate subfolders whose name contains “save”.

Moves by default (configurable).

Supported games (gids) & save formats
gid	Label	Saves	Co-saves	Target directory (under Documents)
skyrim	Skyrim (LE)	.ess	.skse	My Games\Skyrim\Saves
skyrimse	Skyrim Special Edition / AE	.ess	.skse	My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\Saves
oblivion	Oblivion	.ess	.obse	My Games\Oblivion\Saves
morrowind	Morrowind	.ess	—	My Games\Morrowind\Saves
fallout3	Fallout 3	.fos	.fose	My Games\Fallout3\Saves
falloutnv	Fallout: New Vegas	.fos	.nvse	My Games\FalloutNV\Saves
fallout4	Fallout 4	.fos	.f4se	My Games\Fallout4\Saves
starfield	Starfield	.sfs	—	My Games\Starfield\Saves

Note: New remasters/editions can be added by extending the GAMES map (see “Add a new game” below).

Requirements

Vortex (Windows).

Node runtime bundled with Vortex (no external Node install needed).

File system access to %USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\... and %APPDATA%\Vortex\....

Installation

Place index.js (this extension) into your Vortex extension folder or install via your usual Vortex extension method.

Start Vortex (or restart).

SGI starts automatically; no user action required.

Configuration

Edit the constants near the top of index.js:

const MOVE_INSTEAD_OF_COPY = true; // true = move (cut) source files; false = copy only
const DEBUG = false;               // true = verbose run-log + diagnostic toasts

Diagnostics

When DEBUG = true, SGI writes logs to:

%USERPROFILE%\Documents\SGI_Diag\SGI_SaveMover_RunLog.txt

How it works (behavior summary)

Triggers

On startup (delayed ~300ms)

On did-install-mod (for the mod’s gid)

On did-deploy (sweeps all supported gids)

Staging locations scanned

%APPDATA%\Vortex\<gid>\mods

Active install path from util.getVortexPath('install') (if present)

Detection rules

If Data/ exists in a mod → recursively scan it.

Else, treat mod root as a virtual Data/.

Pick up root-level saves.

Recurse into immediate subfolders whose name contains “save”.

For each found save, attempt to attach co-saves by matching the stem and appending the co-save extension(s).

Action

Ensures the destination Saves directory exists.

Move or copy files depending on MOVE_INSTEAD_OF_COPY.

User feedback

Success toast per mod when files are moved.

Optional debug toasts + run-log when DEBUG = true.

Add a new game (e.g., Oblivion Remastered)

When Vortex exposes the new game’s gid, directory, and extensions, add one entry to GAMES:

GAMES.oblivionremastered = {
  label: 'Oblivion Remastered',
  exts: ['.ess'],          // adjust if different
  cosaves: ['.obse'],      // [] if no co-saves
  savesDir: (docs) => path.join(docs, 'My Games', 'Oblivion Remastered', 'Saves'),
};


How to find the gid quickly

Switch game mode in Vortex and read api.getState().settings.gameMode.current (temporary probe):

try {
  const cur = context.api.getState().settings.gameMode.current;
  context.api.sendNotification({ type: 'info', message: `[SGI] current gid: ${cur}`, displayMS: 4000 });
} catch {}


Or install any small mod for the target game; SGI’s did-install-mod handler receives (gid, ...)—log it when DEBUG = true.

Testing checklist

Startup sweep: Launch Vortex with DEBUG = true; confirm run-log entries for each supported gid.

Install path: Install a mod that includes saves. Expect a success toast:
“Moved N save file(s) from <mod> → <Game> Saves”.

Deploy sweep: Press Deploy; run-log should show a sweep per gid.

Co-saves: Include a matching .skse/.nvse/etc. next to a save and confirm it’s moved with the main file.

Troubleshooting

No saves moved

Mod may not contain a Data/ tree or root-level save files.

Save files must have the correct extension for the current gid (see table above).

Wrong destination

Verify your Windows “Documents” path and the My Games\<Game>\Saves folder exists/was created.

Nothing happens on install

Ensure the game is one of the supported gids and that the Vortex install event included a valid installationPath.

Keep originals in the mod

Set MOVE_INSTEAD_OF_COPY = false.

Security & safety

SGI only reads/writes under %APPDATA%\Vortex\... and %USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\....

It does not execute any files from mods, only moves/copies saves.

Changelog
